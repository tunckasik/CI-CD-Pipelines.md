# Welcome to my CI/CD Pipelines Repository
This repository contains a collection of projects and hands-on exercises that I have worked on to gain expertise in Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. I have used popular CI/CD tools such as GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and Azure DevOps to automate the build, test, and deployment processes for various applications and infrastructure components. The repo includes working with different pipeline configurations, environment management, and deployment strategies.
